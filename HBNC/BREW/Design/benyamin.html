        <h1>Tribe of Benyamin</h1>
        <p>
            Genesis 35:18 “And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing: (for she died) that she called his name
            Benoni: but his father called him BENYAMIN.”
        </p>
        <p>Genesis 49:1 “And YA’AQUB called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you
            that
            which shall befall you in the last days.” The last days occur from the days of Christ till today.</p>
        <p>
            The Tribe of BENYAMIN- Sold into Captivity By The Africans And The Arabs
        </p>
        <h1> Maroons </h1>
        <p> The tribe of BENYAMIN (West Indies), along with Yahudah and Lewi, were sold into captivity (by the Africans
            and the Arabs) to the white-man. The white man then transported them in chains on slave ships to Jamaica,
            and various West Indian islands to serve hard bondage as slaves.
        </p>
        <p> During slavery we had the 1 “Maroons “, The word Maroon is Latin meaning wolf, primarily throughout the West
            Indies, which were runaway slaves that fled to the mountains and swamps of the islands. The white man could
            not
            subdue these men because they knew the land very well and could survive on their own; living off the land.
        </p>
        <p> The Maroons firmly believed in liberty or death, in other words, if they could not be free they would rather
            be
            dead.</p>
        <p> Genesis 49:27: “BENYAMIN shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey and at night he
            shall
            divide the spoil.”</p>
        <p> “BENYAMIN shall ravin as a wolf…” The word 2 “ravin” in this sense means speak boldly/harshly. The tribe of
            Benyamin, ravin as wolves through their music by speaking the truth that they are Y’ASHAR’ALY and Yah will
            judge
            Babylon (America and the white race) for the injustice they have done to the children of Ya'shar'al
            (slavery, raping
            our women, dividing the families etc.). For example, in Jamaica, and the other Caribbean islands, the white
            man
            buys up the best parts of the land, and have the people work the land for almost nothing (slave labor). The
            tribe of BENYAMIN, ”ravin” about their suffering and oppression, by singing about it in their music; songs
            contrary to what was forced upon them by the white man through his religions, that Christ and the Israelites
            are
            white etc.
            Certain artists speak through their music of America being Babylon (Psalms 137 proves America is Babylon)
            and
            how it’s going to fall (Revelation 18:19-21); that Christ, Solomon etc. are black according to the Bible,
            and
            also sing about themselves being Israelites. For example Luciano (“The white man’s Kingdom is falling…”),
            Dennis
            Brown (“The Black Revolution…”), Peter Tosh (“Oppressor man where you gonna run to…”), Burning Spear (“Do
            you
            remember the days of slavery…”), Junior Reed (“The Lord is my Shepherd…”). Anthony B (“Fire pan Rome…) also
            “They (white-man) can’t run away from the Judgement Day” and “By the rivers of Babylon…” by various artists.
            Most reggae artists get their inspiration from the Bible; from books like Psalms and Revelation.
            When the scripture says; “…As a wolf…” meaning the same way a wolf howls at its prey before attacking it; is
            the
            same way the tribe of Benjamin, are howling at the white race through their music.
            Genesis 49:27 continues, “…In the Morning He Shall Devour The Prey”, the morning represents the tribe of
            Benjamin, being raised up in rulership in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
        <P> Isaiah 9:2, “The people that walked in darkness (slavery, not knowing your nationality etc.) have seen a
            great
            light (Christ is the light and wisdom, John 8:12 – the kingdom of heaven): they that dwell in the land of
            the
            shadow of death (America), upon them hath the light shined.”
            For a long time, the nation of Israel, has been in darkness (captivity etc.). We were brought here as
            slaves,
            our women and children were raped, and our families destroyed. We were burnt and lynched and had no
            knowledge of
            who we were according to the Bible.
            “…He shall devour the prey…” meaning in the Kingdom of Heaven, the tribe of Benyamin, alongside his brethren
            are
            going to destroy and enslave the white man and all nations; read Psalms 149:6-9 and Obadiah 1:15-19
            Verse 27 continues, and at night he shall divide the spoil”, the night represents the end of the white man’s
            rulership, with the second coming of Christ; read Zephaniah 1:14- 15. It will be the white man’s night
            (captivity) and our day (rulership over the nations). “…He shall divide the spoil.” This means after the
            white
            man and the nations has been enslaved, Benjamin, and the other tribes will divide the riches and wealth of
            the
            nations, read Jeremiah 30:16
            Deuteronomy 33:12, “And of Benyamin he said, the beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the
            Lord
            shall cover him all the day long. and he shall dwell between his shoulders
            “…Shall dwell in safety by him..” this is talking about the Most High, protecting Benjamin, from his enemies
            and
            that the white man during slavery did not kill them off. In the end, the tribe of Benjamin, shall “devour
            the
            prey”, which is the white man and the other nations for enslaving them.
            Deuteronomy 33:12 continues, “…And the Lord shall cover him all the day long…” meaning the Most High, was
            going
            to bless Benjamin, with good weather and land etc.
            Verse 12 continues, “…And he shall dwell between his shoulders.” meaning between the heavens and the waters:
            good climate and good land to plant and grow crops.
            The Following Are Facts Proving That The West Indians Are From The Tribe Of Benjamin
            The following are facts discovered by a so-called Jew (Rabbi Matthew), after in depth study and research
            found
            in a book titled, <b>“From Babylon to Timbuktu”, by Rudolph R. Windsor on page 133:</b>
            <b>“Before Dr. Goodby published his book, “The Lost Tribes a Myth”,</b>Rabbi Matthew organized a Hebrew
            congregation
            in 1918 and proclaimed that the black people of the United States and the West Indies are the original black
            Hebrews.”

        <P>The following is found in a book titled<b> “Nature Knows no Color Line”, by J.A Rogers </b> page 123 & 130.
            “Many of the Jews who were banished from Portugal by John II settled in the West Indies. John Bigelo, who
            visited Jamaica in 1850, saw the descendants of these Jews and says they were Negroid (Black).”</P>
