    <h1>The tribe of Ephraym and Manessah</h1>

    <main>
        <p> Ephraym, was the second born son of Joseph. His name means “I am fruitful”. Manasseh, was the firstborn son
            of Joseph. His name means “made to forget”, read Genesis 41:50-52. The blessing of Joseph, went down to his
            two sons who were
            recognized as two of the tribes of Israel. Jacob, prophesied that Ephraim, would be greater than his brother
            Manasseh; read Genesis 48:13-20 When you see the name “Joseph”, in the scriptures after his death, it is
            making reference to his two sons: Ephraim first then Manasseh. These two tribes led the migration of “The
            Tribes of Israel” to the Americas, in approximately 536 B.C. during the Persian captivity.</p><br>
        <p> Please note that the scriptures often reference Joseph which means Ephraim and Manessah. You may also notice
            a lot of scripture seems to only speak the name Ephraim however remember the blessing was upon Ephraim first
            followed by Manessah.</p><br>
        <p> Genesis 48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger,
            and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
            [15] And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which
            fed me all my life long unto this day,
            [16] The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the
            name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
            [17] And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him:
            and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.
            [18] And Joseph said unto his father; not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon
            his head.
            [19] And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he
            also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a
            multitude of nations.
            [20] And he blessed them that day, saying, in thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make Thee as Ephraim and
            as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p><br>

        <p>During the Middle Ages, the native Indians of Puerto Rico, called themselves Boriqua, a Hebrew word for
            Brave. They called their island 2 Borinquen a Hebrew word for “Land of the Brave Lords” and some
            Translations say “many/abundant” A Hebrew word? Yes a Hebrew word, little do you know that the language
            spoken on the island of Boriquan, prior to the invasion of the Spaniards, was Hebrew. This fact will be
            proven later on in this segment. Where did these so- called Indians 3(from Indios Latin word for slave) come
            from? Did they come thru the Bering Straits, as recorded by the white-man? No! They came from a land known
            as Israel, in the Middle East.</p><br>
        <p> The following passage will prove the previous statement; it is found in a book titled “Yucatan Before and
            After the Conquest” by Friar Diego de Landa on page 8. It contains what the natives told the Spaniards, of
            their trip to the New World, and of what descent they were.
            “Some old men of Yucatan say that they have heard from their ancestors that this country was peopled by a
            certain race who came from the East. Whom God delivered by opening for them twelve roads through the sea. If
            this is true, all the inhabitants of the Indies must be of Jewish descent…”
            When they arrived to the New World, the tribes began to drop each other off beginning in South America, then
            moving upward to Central America, the islands of Puerto Rico, Cuba, Hispaniola and finally North America. In
            history books the natives of the Americas, are often called Arawaks The word Arawak, means groups of
            indigenous peoples that migrated from South America, to Central and North America.</p><br>
        <p> So how do we know that Ephraim, ended up in Puerto Rico and Manesseh in Cuba? We must examine the history of
            what the natives called themselves when the various Spanish explorers or priests encountered them. Keep this
            in mind, that all the so-called Indians spoke the same language prior to the invasion of the Spaniards. This
            language as was proven earlier was Hebrew That’s why they had various trade routes to exchange and sell
            different materials. If they could not communicate with each other, these routes would not have existed. For
            example the Seminole Indians and the Boriqua Indians, had close relations in trading and visited each other
            frequently. Even Ponce de Leon, learned of these relations in his search for the mythical “fountain of
            youth”; the boriqua Indians, sent him to the Seminoles in Florida. Now, lets prove that Ephraim, ended up in
            Puerto Rico and Manesseh in Cuba.</p><br>
        <p> The following is what happened to Montezinos (a Spanish explorer), when he visited the Seminole Indians, in
            the mountains of Quito, prior to their migration to Florida. This passage contains what was told to him by
            the natives concerning their identity and the identity of their brothers located in Puerto Rico and Cuba.
            This information is found in “Lost Tribes and Promised Lands” by Ronald Sanders on pages 363-365
            “Upon hearing her words they rose, went over to Montezinos and, to his utter astonishment, said: “Shema,
            Yisroel, Adonai Elohenu Adonai Ehod” (Hear; O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One”). They had recited,
            in Hebrew the fundamental credo of YAH'SHAR'AL. ”
            “They told him that they were themselves of the tribe of Reuben, and that the tribe of Joseph lived on an
            island nearby ° <b>[What’s nearby? Puerto Rico and Cuba]</b>
            “Only the sorcerers of his tribe had perceived that they were a special people, and had given warning that
            they should be left alone.” The God of these children of YAH'SHAR'AL is the true God, they had said, “and
            everything inscribed on their tablets is true. At the end of days, they will be lords of all the nations of
            the earth. One nation will come bringing many things to this land, and after we have all been provided for,
            these children of Israel will go forth from where they now are and reign over the whole earth, as they once
            did. ”</p><br>
        <p>Genesis 49:1 “And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that
            which shall befall you in the last days ‘ The last days occur from the days of Christ till today. See
            Hebrews 1:2.</p><br>
        <p> Genesis 49:22, “Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the
            wall.”</p><br>
        <p>The blessing of Joseph, went down to his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh. A “bough” is a tree, so when the
            scripture says; “even a fruitful bough by a well” it is showing us a comparison of how a tree that is
            planted near water is fruitful the same way the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, would be located near water
            (island) and be very fruitful. Cuba means “fruitful” and just like the name says The so-called Puerto
            Ricans, are fruitful by having many children and very large families as well. “Whose branches run over the
            wall…” the same way branches go over a wall that divides them from other trees and branches, to mix with
            them, is the same way the daughters of Ephraim, went over the wall of racial division to mix with the
            Spanish, by marrying the Spaniards. The Spanish, built a fort in Puerto Rico, encompassed by what’s called
            “El Morro” meaning “the wall” which was meant to keep other invading whites from stealing Boriqua slaves
            and taking Puerto Rico. The daughters of the Boricua had children from the Spanish Conquistador but what
            does the Most High say would happen to many of their children?</p><br>
        <p>Hosea 9:11” As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and
            from the conception.
            [12] Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea,
            woe also to them when I depart from them!
            [13] Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to
            the murderer. [Ephraim gave their girls to marry the Spanish]
            [14] Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts”. Proving the boy
            children died at birth that’s why in verse 12 it said ‘ there shall not be a man left’ because the male
            carries the seed. If the male offspring survived then they would produce Edomite children and not Ephraim.
            The girl children survived and lived and married the Puerto Rican Indians bringing forth true ephraimite
            children.</p><br>
        <p> Because of this racial mixing, some Puerto Ricans, are very light-skinned. The Bible prophesied about this
            mixing read Hosea 7:8</p><br>
        <p>Hosea 7:8 “Ephraim has mixed himself among the people: Ephraim is a cake not turned.”
            The people that Ephraim (Puerto Ricans), mixed himself with were the Spaniards. When the scripture says;
            “Ephraim is a cake not turned” means that the same way a pancake is not turned when baked, one side would be
            dark and the other side light, is similar to the complexion of the so-called Puerto Ricans, which range from
            a dark brown to a very light skinned some even appear Caucasian. But, only those whose fathers are of
            Boriquan descent are Israelites, if their fathers are Spaniards, then they are Spaniards. Back to Genesis.
            Genesis 49:23, “The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him.
            The °archers” are talking about the conquistadors of Spain. They sorely grieved Ephraim, by having the
            Boriqua Indians work in gold mines and sugar cane fields under very hard and strenuous conditions. “And shot
            at him…’’ When Columbus came in 1493, he subdued Ephraim with great slaughter. Also when 8Ponce de Leon,
            came in 1508, he had 6,000 Boriqua Indians, shot because they protested slave working conditions. Out of
            40,000 Boriqua Indians, only 4,000 remained on the island of Puerto Rico, during this invasion. “And hated
            him…”The Spaniards, enslaved Ephraim and sent thousands of them to serve slavery in Spain, and Hawaii on
            slave ships (Deuteronomy 28:68) and stripped Puerto Rico, of it’s wealth and riches.</p><br>
        <p>Genesis 49:24, “But his bow abode in strength, and the arm of his hands were made strong by the hands of the
            mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd the stone of Israel;)</p><br>
        <p>Joseph’s bow abode in strength because he kept the commandments. His hands were made strong when the Most
            High, honored Joseph, by making him second overall Egypt. “From thence is the shepherd the stone of Israel”,
            is referring to Christ, he is the Shepard / stone of YAH'SHAR'RAL that came from the mighty god/power of
            Jacob.</p><br>
        <p>Genesis 49:25, “Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee (Ephraim); and by the Almighty who shall
            bless thee (Ephraym) with blessings of Heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of
            the breasts and the womb.”
            The “blessings of the Heaven above” is talking about the good weather on the island of Puerto Rico.
            “Blessings of the deep that lieth under” refers to the seas and riches on the island. Also the various
            exotic fish in the deep ocean. That is why the so called white-man exploits the beauty of Puerto Rico by
            making commercials about “Come to Puerto Rico the shining star in these commercials you see Caucasians
            running on the beaches and going deep sea diving, enjoying the blessings that the Heavenly Father gave
            Ephraim, of the heaven above and of the deep. So what did the Spanish white-man do? He killed thousands of
            the Boriqua Indians, stole their island, and now he goes there on vacation.</p><br>

        <p>
            Genesis 49:25 continues, “… blessings of the breasts and the womb.”
            This is referring to Ephraim, being fruitful with many children which is a beautiful blessing. So although
            many Boriqua Indians were killed, Ephraim’s fruitfulness kept the tribes in existence because of the Most
            High’s blessings.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            Genesis 49:26, “The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the
            utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be in the head of Joseph, and on the crown of him that was
            separated from his brethren.”
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Jacob is letting Ephraim know that his father’s blessings were greater than the blessings of Abraham and
            Isaac while they lived, because Joseph was extremely famous and was second under Pharaoh in Egypt and owned
            a vast amount of lands within Egypt. Joseph, being in this position was able to support his father and the
            rest of his brethren and their children.
        </p><br>

        <p>

            Deuteronomy 33:13 “And of Joseph he said, blessed of the Lord be his land, for the precious things of
            heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath.”
        </p><br>
        <p>

            The blessing of Joseph, went to his son Ephraim. This scripture links up to Genesis 49:25, “Even by the God
            of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
            blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:”, making reference to the
            great climate on the island of Boriquen (Puerto Rico).
        </p><br>

        <p>
            Deuteronomy 33:14 “And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things brought
            forth by the moon.”
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The “precious fruits brought forth by sun” is talking about mangos, papayas, avocados, pineapples, coconuts,
            bananas and sugar cane, which are fruits the island is well known for.
            The “precious things brought forth by the moon” one of those things is the “coqui” which is a small frog
            that can only live in Puerto Rico. The “coqui” comes out at night and makes a very distinctive whistle
            throughout the night.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Deuteronomy 33:15, “And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the
            lasting hills.”
        </p><br>
        <p>

            The “chief things of the ancient mountains” is talking about the great amount of diamonds, gold and silver
            found in the mountains of Boriquen; which was the primary source of slave labor that the Boriqua Indians
            were made to serve. The “precious things of the lasting hills” is talking about the coffee beans found in
            the hills of the island.
        </p><br>
        <p>

            Deuteronomy 33:16, “And for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof, and for the good will of
            him that dwelt in the bush….”
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The “good will of him that dwelt in the bush” means that it was the good will of the Lord (because the Lord
            spoke to Moses in the bush) that Ephraim made it to the “New World” and survived the savage attacks of the
            Spaniards.
        </p><br>
        <p>

            Verse 16 continues, “…let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him
            that was separated from his brethren.”
            This is referring to the blessings that Joseph got when he was sold by his brothers and ended up in Egypt.
            Deuteronomy 33:17 “His glory is like the firstling of his bullock and his horns are like the horns of
            unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten
            thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.”
            Deuteronomy 33:17: “His glory is like the firstling of a bullock, and his horns are like the horns of
            unicorns..
            “His glory is like the firstling of a bullock”, means all firstborn males are chosen by the Most High to be
            his, his horns refers to the leaders of Ephraim and Manessah. The Lord used the leaders of Ephraim and
            Manessah to push/guide the 10 tribes of Israel to the ends of the earth meaning the other side of the
            world-Arsareth / the Americas. </p><br>
        <p>
            Read 2 Esdras 13:40-45.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Hosea 11:10 “They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the
            children shall tremble from the west.” (western hemisphere)
        </p><br>
        <b>Hosea 4:17, “Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.”</b>
        <p>
            The bible prophesied how the so-called Puerto Ricans & Cubans (Ephraim & Manessah) would have many idols.
            The false white images of Christ (Caesar Borgia), Mary and Lazarus are the main idols that they are joined
            to. They worship these idols by putting tattoos of these images on their bodies, putting statues on the
            dashboard of their cars and wearing gold chains with these false images as pendants. Also in their homes
            they make altars with the pictures of these images in the center with different color candles around it.
            “Let him alone” means when you show a Puerto Rican that Christ is a black-man and they don’t want to accept
            it just leave him alone.
        </p><br>
        <p>

            Hosea 8:11, “Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him a sin.”
            Verse 12, 7 have written to him the great things of my law. But they were counted as a strange thing.”
            “Ephraim (Puerto Ricans) hath made many alters to sin” means that when they make these altars and worship
            these false images they commit sin by breaking the first and second commandment of the Most High, “Thou
            shalt have no other gods before me” and “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image nor serve them.” The
            many altars that the Puerto Ricans keep in their homes have become a sin unto them and they will not see the
            Kingdom of Heaven if they do not repent and cast away these powerless idols. The Heavenly Father tells us
            that he wrote unto Ephraim the many great things of his law but Ephraim thought the laws of the Most High to
            be strange because of the lies taught to them by the white-man. And it is because of these lies that the
            Puerto Ricans think it strange that the Bible is their history; that they are the tribe of Ephraim and the
            Cubans are the tribe of Manessah . Hosea 8:12 7 have written to him the great things of my law, but they
            were counted as a strange thing.”
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            Does the Bible prophecy about the rich and pleasant island that Ephraim would get when they migrated to the
            “New World”? Yes!
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            Hosea 12:8 “And Ephraim said, yet I am become rich I have found me out substance…” Ephraim said 7 am become
            rich” because of all the riches that was on the island, that’s why the Spaniards named the island rich port
            (Puerto Rico). Substance meaning wealth.
        </p><br>

        <p>

            Hosea 9:13, “Ephraim as I saw Tyrus is planted in a pleasant place…”
            Tyrus was a rich seaport city in ancient times. So the Most high said he saw Ephraim planted in a pleasant
            place. The pleasant (beautiful) place that the so-called Puerto Ricans (Ephraim) are living in is Boriquen
            or Puerto Rico which was full of gold, silver and precious stones.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Does the Bible prophecy about the coming of the Spaniards to the island of Boriquen and what occurred when
            they got there. Yes!
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Hosea 13:15-16, “Though he be fruitful among his brethren…” Ephraim (Puerto Ricans) was fruitful among his
            brethren in having many children which was and is a blessing from the Most High.
            Verse 15 continues, “…an east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness…” The
            east wind that came was the Conquistadors (so-called white-man) coming from the east (Spain). They were the
            east wind of the Lord because he caused them to come against the so-called Puerto Ricans. Why? Read
            Deuteronomy 28:47-50
            Verse 15 continues, “his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the
            treasure of pleasant vessels.”
            This is talking about when the Spaniards reached Puerto Rico and Cuba and started looting all the gold,
            silver, diamonds and rubies that the Boriqua Indians had in the form of jewelry, plates and cups.
            Verse 16, “Samaria shall become desolate: for she hath rebelled against her God:”
            Samaria is making reference to the tribe of Ephraim (so-called Puerto Ricans). The city of Samaria belonged
            to Ephraim. Ephraim became desolate when they were destroyed by the Spaniards because they went away from
            the laws of the Heavenly Father.
            Verse 16 continues, “. . . They shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces and their
            women with child shall be ripped up. ”
            These things happened to the so-called Puerto Ricans and Cubans when the Spaniards invaded them. The white
            man would grab the babies of the Boriqua and Cuban Indians by the legs and dash them against trees and
            rocks, then let the dogs eat the babies. The pregnant women were ripped open with the swords and had their
            children ripped out of their stomach and thrown to the ground. They would then stomp the babies’ skull,
            crushing it and leaving it lifeless where it lay. Who did this? The white man who called himself Spanish.
            The following is pictorial proof of what was read in Hosea 13:16. It is found in a book titled “American
            Holocaust” pages 148-149

            ‘‘[The Spaniards] took babies from their mothers’ breasts, grabbing them by the feet and smashing their
            heads against rocks…”
            Hosea 4:6. “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge…”
            The Puerto Ricans and all the rest of the Tribes of Israel are destroyed because they don’t know their true
            history, culture, language, laws, their God and Savior which is all found in the Holy Bible
