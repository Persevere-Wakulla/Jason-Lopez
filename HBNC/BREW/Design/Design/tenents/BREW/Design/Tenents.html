          <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

        <p>WE LIVE IN THE DAYS OF ABSOLUTE, WICKEDNESS. 
         WHERE ANYTHING GOES WITHOUT QUESTION,  NEVER 
         TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OUR ACTIONS. CONSTANTLY GOING 
         ABOUT OUR LIVES WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE CREATOR
         OF ALL THINGS IN EXISTENCE, BY BUILDING A LIFE
         WITHOUT FAITH, WITHOUT WORKS (TURAH) AND WITHOUT PURPOSE.</p>

            <p>“FOR I KNOW THE PLANS I AM PLANNING FOR YOU,
             DECLARES <img src="./YHUH.png" alt="">,
              PLANS OF PEACE AND NOT OF EVIL.”
            (Y’RMAYAHU 29:11)</p>

            <p>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TRUE SEED OF ABRAHAM,
            Y’TSCHAQ, AND YA’AQUB? THE CONSECRATED ONES?
            IS THERE ANYONE LEFT? THIS SCROLL/RECORD OF
            FACTS HAS BEEN DESIGNED FOR THOSE WHO TRULY
            SEEK RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE KINGDOM OF 
            <img src="./YHUH.png" alt="">. BECAUSE
            AS A PEOPLE, WE MUST LEARN TO DEDICATE
            OUR ENTIRE LIVES TO A PARTICULAR COURSE OF
            THOUGHT, AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BECOME SET
            APART FROM THE WORLD EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE
            SPECIAL USE OF OUR HEAVENLY FATHER YAHUAH AND HIS
            ONLY BEGOTTEN SON YAHUSHA HA’MASHYACH. SO
            I MUST ADMONISH YOU, BE NOT FAINT IN THESE
            LAST DAYS, AND STAND WITH YASHARAHLA AGAINST
            ALL FORMS OF WICKED ADVERSITY.
            </p>
   
            <p>“IF THOU FAINT IN THE DAY OF ADVERSITY, THY
              STRENGTH IS SMALL”. (MASHAL 24:10)</p>

        AS A (MAN/WOMAN) I WAS BORN IN BLOOD AND PAIN TO MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER. I LIVED AS THEY TAUGHT AND I FOLLOWED THEIR STEPS, NEVER ONCE DOUBTING THEIR WAYS. ALL THAT I KNOW I HAVE LEARNED FROM THEY WHO RAISED ME.
        
        
            • NOW I KNOW THAT I KNEW NOTHING, BECAUSE I DID NOT REVERE  ( MASHAL 1:7 )
            • I WAS BORN OF THE FLESH ( YAHUCHANAN 3:6 )  AND I MUST BE BORN OF THE RUACH (YAHUCHANAN 3:3-5)
            • THAT I MUST HEAR THE DABAR-   AND BELIEVE BY ONE WHO IS SENT TO PROCLAIM ( RUMY’YM 10:13-17 )
            • THAT I MUST NOT ONLY BE A HEARER OF THE DABAR BUT ALSO A DOER OF WORK ( YA’AQUB 1:22-25 ) 
            • THAT BELIEF WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD ( YA’AQUB 2:14-16 )
            • THAT I MUST BE BORN AGAIN AND BE QUDASH IN ALL MY WAYS ( KAPHA ALAPH 1:13-25 )
            • THAT I MUST BE TAUGHT THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF THE DABAR-   AS A CHILD ( ABARYM 5:12-14 ) 
            • THAT I WILL ACCEPT DISCIPLINE AS A BAN AS FROM   FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS ( ABARYM 12:5-11; DABARYM 8:5; MASHAL 13:24 )
            • THAT I MUST ENTER THE REIGN OF SHAMAYM AS A CHILD IN HUMILITY ( MATHYTHYAHU 18:1-6 )
            • THAT I MUST LEARN TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE RUACH AND BECOME A BAN OF AL’HYM ( RUMY’YM 8:1-17 )
            • THIS DAY, ( MOON = DAY ), I MAKE THIS SOLEMN OATH, TO SUBMIT TO THE RUACH OF  AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE PAQYDYM BACHYRATH , TO HEAR, LEARN, APPLY, AND PERFORM, EVERY WORD THAT COMES FROM THE MOUTH OF  AS I AM INSTRUCTED BY MY AB,  CHAY.
